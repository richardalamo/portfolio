# Ricardo Alamo Portfolio

Hello!

You can review all my projects in more detai here https://www.ricardoalamosalgado.com/

I am a Civil Engineer turned Data Scientist with a passion for leveraging data-driven solutions to drive business improvement and optimize performance.

My journey in the field began with a 5-year tenure as a Data Analyst, where I gained substantial experience in statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling.

Recognizing the importance of business acumen in data science, I completed my MBA in 2018 to develop a deeper understanding of business operations, strategic management, and decision-making processes.

To further reinforce my technical skills and stay at the forefront of this rapidly evolving field, I completed a Data Science Diploma in 2023. This program provided me with a strong foundation in key areas such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Big Data techniques, and further ignited my passion for data science.

In my portfolio, you will find examples of my work that reflect my hands-on experience in data science. I am always open to discussing new projects and opportunities, so please feel free to reach out.
